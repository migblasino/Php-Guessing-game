Gameplay Example:

If the player guesses 50 and the correct answer was 70, the response might be:

"Too low! The correct number has been shuffled."

If the next guess is 90, the response might be:

"Too high! The correct number has been shuffled."


PHP Guessing Game
====================
A simple PHP-based number guessing game where the player must guess a number between 1 and 100. Each time the player makes an incorrect guess, the correct answer is shuffled, adding an extra level of challenge. The game tracks the number of attempts and allows the player to restart the game.

Features
--------
Random Target Number: The target number is randomly generated between 1 and 100.
Shuffling Logic: After every incorrect guess, the target number is reshuffled to another random number, making it harder to guess.
User Feedback: Provides feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Attempts Tracker: Tracks and displays the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.
Restart Option: Allows players to restart the game and reset the target number.
